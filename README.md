I have over 14 years of experience in the software industry, of which nine as a Java developer and the last five focused on DevOps with some minor assignments in quality assurance and development. 

Therefore I have a clear understanding of the software life cycle and was there when projects started moving from waterfall to Agile, from Ops to DevOps and from hosted servers to the cloud.

At the moment, I'm interested in automating tasks that no one sees but have to be done. And my studies are focused on Kubernetes, Python and AWS.
